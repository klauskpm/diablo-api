# diablo-api
Diablo III API integration using AngularJS 2 with TypeScript and Node.js

### Usage
For usage of this repository, you need to clone it and setup the npm dependencies.  

#### Installing npm and dependencies
To do that, you need to install the **npm**. Follow those links if 
[you don't know what npm is](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) or if 
[you don't know how to install npm](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm).

After you installed npm go to the folder where you cloned this repository, on your terminal, and run `npm install`.
This will install all the dependencies from **package.json** inside a folder named *node_modules*,
which you don't have to mind looking at.

#### Setting up the API
If you look inside the root folder(the foolder you cloned this repository) you will find a configuration file inside `/app/diablo/config/`.
You can copy it or just remove the *sample.* from the file and set the variables.

Since their API is not something so open, I find it would be a pain to give the information about their API url, but,
anyone with access to it can use this repository.
